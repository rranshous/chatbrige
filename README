how to run:

start a subscription manager processes. it's your api and admin interface
for adding subscriptions.

a subscription is a subscription to the messages in a room. adding a subscription
causes messages from the room to be sent to the target href. The target
can optionally return a message which will be sent back to the room under
the alias of the sender.

you don't start sender containers your self. they are started by the
subscription manager.

after you've started a subscription you should be able to run `docker ps` and
see the sender docker container running on the system.

there will be one sender docker container per subscription.

if you are not running the subscription manager in it's docker container than
be sure to set the DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME env variable. The docker container will
default it for you to the public image of the sender (rranshous/chatbridge_sender)

subscription manager:
 web app which allows users to set up new subscriptions to rooms
  give it your API key, the room you want to watch, the 'sender' name to post under
  and the target endpoint you want messages sent to and it'll send them to you

sender:
 container which polls the chat room, sends messages to endpoint and sends responses from target back to room

receiver:
 sample messages handler, has different endpoints for different types of responses.
 set the target of your subscription to the receiver
